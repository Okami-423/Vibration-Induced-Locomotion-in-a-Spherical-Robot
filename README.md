# Vibration-Induced-Locomotion-in-a-Spherical-Robot-With-Integrated-Gas-Sensor

This project presents a vibration-driven spherical robot designed for gas leak detection in debris-filled and confined environments, such as post-disaster rubble or collapsed structures.

The robot uses four vibrating motors mounted inside a spherical shell, arranged symmetrically and angled at 120°, with two motors on each side. By selectively activating and modulating these motors, the robot achieves locomotion through vibration, allowing it to move, roll, and navigate through narrow gaps and uneven debris where wheeled or legged robots may fail.

A gas sensor is integrated into the system to continuously monitor the surrounding environment for hazardous gas leaks. When gas concentration exceeds a predefined threshold, the robot can log, transmit, or indicate the presence of a leak, enabling early detection in unsafe areas without direct human intervention.

##Key Features

*Vibration-based locomotion (no wheels or legs)

*4 angled vibrating motors (120° configuration, 2 per side)

Spherical design for omnidirectional movement
